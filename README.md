# DataQuality

__dataquality-bnr__ is a library built on top of __AWS PyDeequ__. The goal was to develop a solution who enables deep data quality measurement based on simple .yaml file constraint specifications. Empower business focus members, so that they can directly contribute to dataQuality specifications at ETL pipelines without needing to code anything.
